//! The documentation corpus (PROP-045 §7): every page of the `vibevm-docs`
//! package walks the genre's own laws on the live text.
//!
//! * **byte idempotence** — under [`Vocabulary::Doc`] the writer's own
//!   output is a fixed point: `IR → XML → IR` keeps the IR and the second
//!   `XML` is the first byte for byte (the same law, and the same
//!   formulation, as `redbook_xml_to_ir_to_xml_is_byte_idempotent`);
//! * **the gate** — the same page is REFUSED by the default spec reader,
//!   with a message naming the genre (##DOC-VOCAB-LOUD-IN-SPEC);
//! * **one way to Markdown** — the projection of the genre re-parses to a
//!   different IR, and that is the law (##DOC-VOCAB-MD-ONE-WAY);
//! * **shape** — the construct counts, so a corpus edit that silently
//!   loses coverage of an element fails here.
//!
//! Two bounded lists sit beside those laws, because the live corpus was
//! authored before a reader existed for it. [`QUARANTINED`] names the
//! pages the pivot cannot read AT ALL and why — defects of the pages, not
//! of the pivot, each pinned to its exact refusal; it is EMPTY today, and
//! the machinery stays for the next page written ahead of its reader.
//! [`NOT_CANONICAL`] names the pages that parse but whose own bytes are
//! not what the writer emits. [`PLAIN_PAGES`] names the pages that carry
//! no construct of the genre at all, so the two genre laws cannot tell
//! them from a spec. [`UNPARSABLE_PROJECTIONS`] names the pages whose
//! Markdown projection quotes the markup itself and so does not re-parse.
//! All four are tripwires: repair a page and the test that guards its
//! entry fails, which is how the entry gets deleted.
//!
//! This is the counterpart of `redbook_roundtrip.rs`, which holds the same
//! laws for the spec vocabulary on a `flow` package.

///   of PROP-057 `##OBS-AUDIENCE-AGENT`) and the page joined the corpus.
/// * `glossary/index.xml` — the glossary's entry for the word «fact» was
