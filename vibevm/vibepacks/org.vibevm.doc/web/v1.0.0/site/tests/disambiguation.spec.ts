/** @scope spec://org.vibevm.core/vibevm/common/PROP-057#SITE-ONE-SITE */

/**
 * Which VibeVM this is — and which it is not — everywhere a crawler reads
 * it.
 *
 * Search engines and model crawlers had been joining this project with
 * its namesakes — Phala Network's VibeVM, a development sandbox on Phala
 * Cloud; the tgbyte project of the same name; and, for the AI Native
 * Languages, the karanchawla VVM project (owner, 2026-09-26). The site
 * says so in four places, in the owner's own sentences: at the foot of
 * both landings, in the root `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`, and in the
 * structured data. A sentence that quietly went missing from one of them
 * would be the index's cue to join the two again, so each place is held
 * here.
 *
 * What is NOT here is anything about those projects. Each note names one
 * and says nothing further about it, and nothing on the site links to
 * one; the tests below check the words this site publishes, in the exact
 * form it publishes them.
 *
 * Since 2026-09-27 the other half of that question is held here too: what
 * the project IS called. The name is one string in `landing/identity.ts`
 * and several surfaces print it — the note under the lead, the two meta
 * values, the signature at the foot of every landing page, the graph's
 * application and website nodes, the `isPartOf` of every subpage, and the
 * title of the feed. A surface that kept the short name while its
 * neighbours took the full one is the same defect as a missing note: an
 * index with two answers to one question.
